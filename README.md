# Real Time Traffic sign detection
 This project demonstrates the classification of traffic signs in video sequences, using deep learning convolutional network architecture. This uses Pytorch framework for implementation fo the deep learning network architecture. The model was trained on a custom dataset of 10 most common traffic signs in India. The dataset consisted of entirely 1000 images for each class label(after using data augumentation techniques). 
 Software packages used: Python, OpenCV, Pytorch, torchvision
 How To Run:
 Clone the repository, and run the sign_detection.py script.
